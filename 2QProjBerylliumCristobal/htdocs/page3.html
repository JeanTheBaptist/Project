     <p> The Jura Tempest Federation is known as a monster nation, and is inhabited by a diverse number of monsters. The creatures in Tempest can be split into groups depending on when they were recruited.</p>

     <h2> 1st Group: Hobgoblins</h2>
     <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Rigurd, Rigur and Gobta</p>
     <br>
     <p> Hobgoblins are C Rank monsters in the Tensura world. They are faster, stronger and smarter than the normal goblin. Rimuru met this group when they were still goblins, but they later evolved thanks to Rimuru’s power. After helping them defend against Dire Wolves, Rimuru took control of the Village and essentially became the basis of his country. In the story, they work as warriors, chefs, social workers and politicians, with the ones in charge of territories mostly being the Hobgoblins.</p>

    <h2> 2nd Group: Star Wolves</h2>
    <p  style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Ranga</p>
    <br>
    <p> Star Wolves are B+ Rank monsters in the Tensura world. They are Dire Wolves which have a strong aptitude for magic and are physically stronger than Dire Wolves. When they were still dire wolves, they terrorized the Goblin Village but were quickly subdued by Rimuru, and later joined his group which cause them to evolve. When working, we often see them as cavalry, warriors, guards and transportation.

    <h2> 3rd Group: Dwarves</h2>
    <p  style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Kaijin, Myrd, Dord and Garm</p>
    <br>
    <p> Dwarves have no set rank in the Tensura world, unlike monsters. The dwarves were fantastic craftsmen and artisans, and are a non-monster race. Upon visiting Dwargo, Rimuru saved the dwarf, Kaijin, from execution. After this, Kaijin and his other friends joined the group and helped expand Jura Tempest. The dwarf, Kaijin, was an expert weaponsmith while his friends were masters of architecture.

    <h2> 4th Group: Kijin</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Hakurou, Benimaru, Shuna, Shion and Souei</p>
    <br>
    <p> Kijin range from B+ to Special A rank. They are ogres who have enlightened themselves, and have a strong aptitude for magic. When they were still ogres, their home was destroyed, and they eventually mistook Rimuru as the attacker. After Rimuru helped them in getting revenge, they joined the group and evolved into Kijin. The Kijin are major characters, and all work as warriors, secretaries or seamstresses.

    <h2> 5th Group: Dragonewts</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Gabiru and Souka</p>
    <br>
    <p> Dragonewts are B Rank monsters in the Tensura world. They are an evolved form of Lizardmen, who have dragon-like wings and can breathe fire. When they were still Lizardmen, they were being attacked by armies of orcs, and asked for the aid of Rimuru and his subordinates. After Rimuru saved their tribe, they joined the group and evolved into Dragonewts. They work as warriors and grass collectors.

    <h2> 6th Group: High Orcs</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Geld</p>
    <br>
    <p> High Orcs are C Rank monsters in the Tensura world. They are an evolved form of orcs, and have higher endurance, stamina and physical prowess. When they were still orcs, they were driven mad by famine and attacked the Ogre and Lizardmen tribes. After Rimuru saved them, they joined the group to atone for their actions. High Orcs are prominently seen as warriors or engineers, lifting heavy loads.

    <h2> 7th Group: Varied Creatures</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Apito, Zegion, Gard and Koby</p>
    <br>
    <p> Just when Jura Tempest started to grow exponentially, a slew of monsters and non-monsters joined the group. These included humans, kobold, goblins, lizardmen, insect spirits and wyverns. We usually see them as civilians or providing service of some sort, whether it be in trading or in the military. Because of this, Tempest’s different organizations, ministries and groups were finalized into a system.

    <h2> 8th Group: Demons and Majin</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Notable Members: Myulan, Adalman, Ninehead and Diablo</p>
    <br>
    <p> Majin are usually A Rank while Demons are at least B Rank monsters. Demons are powerful monsters which excel in magic and physical abilities, while Majin are immensely magical creatures. Unlike the other inhabitants, not many Demons are in Jura Tempest in the current events of the anime., while most of the Majin are prisoners-of-war converted into civilians. They usually work as warriors or guards.
