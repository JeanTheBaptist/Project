         <h2> The Tempest Labyrinth</h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/e/ed/LN_12_01.jpg">
         <p> The Tempest Labyrinth is a 100-Floor Labyrinth owned partially by Rimuru and Ramiris. This dungeon is almost like an open challenge for adventurers, and increases in difficulty the higher the floor. For example, the second floor has F Ranks while the last boss of the dungeon is a Special S Rank. The floors themselves greatly vary in themes, some having the theme of death and another having the theme of nature and so on. In this labyrinth, there are bosses from some floors who are some of the most trusted men Rimuru has.</p>

      <div id="cave">
         <h2> The Sealed Cave </h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://animesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tensei-Shitara-Slime-Datta-Ken-OAD-01_01.38_2019.12.20_14.15.09_stitch.jpg">
         <p>The Sealed Cave was the location in which Rimuru reincarnated as he became a slime. Originally this place sealed Veldora, the Storm Dragon and a being with incredibly powerful amounts of magic. Because of this, the cave accumulated magic, and were absorbed by the orhanisms and things inside. This in turn strengthened the creatures, but also improved the quality of the raw materials inside. In this cave is the prized Hipokute Grass, capable of making potions of 99% effectiveness, which is incredibly valuable.</p>

      <div id="lake">
         <h2> Lake Siss</h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/b/bd/Lake_Siss.png">
         <p> Lake Siss is a sort of swamplands in the center of the Great Jura Forest and was inhabited by the Lizardmen Tribe, a high-ranking tribe in the Great Jura Forest Hierarchy, before they evolved into Dragonewts. The entirety of the lake is filled with underground caves, which the lizardmen have made their homes. It is in this lake where the Orc Disaster attacked the lizardmen, and thus were saved by Rimuru. Currently, it is still inhabited by Dragonewts and Lizardmen, with the former chief Abiru continuing to lead the tribe.</p>

         <h2> Storm Dragon, Veldora </h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/a/a1/Episode_1.png">
         <p>Veldora is a True Dragon and was known as the Storm Dragon. When he was still sealed in the cave, his very existence was made a landmark. Because of his bad reputation and intimidating power, many merchants and humans avoided the Great Jura Forest as much as possible. The entirety of the Great Jura Forest is under his Divine Protection named “Crest of the Storm”. Because of this, he was revered as a guardian deity from the monsters who lived in the forest. He was eventually freed from the seal by Rimuru.</p>

         <h2> Rimuru City</h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/e/e4/Tempest_13.5.jpg">
         <p> Rimuru City was the capital city of Jura Tempest Federation, and was where it all started. Originally, it was a Goblin Village near the Sealed Cave, but Rimuru helped it progress and eventually became the basis of his kingdom. There are a multitude of shops and merchants in this city, as well as different recreational facilities like the Arena and music hall, and events like festivals. Aside from that, it also has a good irrigation and agricultural system in order to give the inhabitants a better life. Notable locations in this city include the hot springs, the City Hall and Rimuru’s house.</p>

         <h2> The Great Jura Forest</h2>
         <img id="image" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/images/f/f8/Treant-Dryad_Settlement.png">
         <p> The Great Jura Forest is located near the center of the continent, and is a lush forest filled with varied monsters and resources. The forest’s monster and resource variety stems from the fact that Veldora’s magic is being absorbed by the nearby resources and caused the forest to grow so large. The dryads are the guardians of the forest out of gratitude for Veldora taking them in. The forest is at a zone which borders kingdoms such as Dwargon and Blumund, and was formerly owned by Veldora (Currently Rimuru’s Territory).</p>
